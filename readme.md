# Industrial Revolition

![logo](IndustrialRevolution/logo.png "")

This mod makes civilian transport ships more important. (and more industrial stuff planned)

- Resource import relies directly on arriving trade ships
  When trade ships are being shot down, the connection they represent will be disabled until the next ship actually arrives.

# done
- asteroids spawn trade ships (which can be shot down)
- Added "Blockaded Export" status, the specific resource is blocked if ships are shot down until new ones arrive

# todo
- move trade stations to be at 'exit points' of systems
