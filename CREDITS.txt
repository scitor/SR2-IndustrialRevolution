# First, most thanks go to the creators of this great game! Thank you, awesome stuff!

Many ideas for this mod come from talks in discord or playing other mods like RS or SoI.
This is just a collection of changes to the game I wanted to do.
It's made available online so others can enjoy it, there are no guarantees or promises.

Afaik I didn't copy any code but ideas were taken for which I'm very thankful.
If you find anything that doesn't belong in here, please contact me asap!
