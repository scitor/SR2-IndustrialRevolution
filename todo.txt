### done
- more asteroids (more shards, resource asteroids got companions too. needs tuning)
- changed civilian trade ship navigation
    - asteroids with mining bases spawn trade ships (which can be destroyed, thus blockaded)
    - added "Blockaded Export" status, the specific resource is blockaded if ships are shot down until new ones arrive
      old "Blockaded" status still applies to the target planet, if the ship was carrying goods from a trade station (currently disabled)
    - trade ships don't reassign to random planets after delivering inter-system resources anymore.
- moved trade stations to be at 'exit points' of systems, repurposed back to trading
- every planet has a "Customs Office" now, will spawn ships slower until CO is present
- civilians (from a foreign empire) are enemies too for AI (Remnants attack Civs now)
- added Statuses to Asteroids
- multiple ships per route (every 3 or 2min)
- almost complete restructure of civilian navigation
- removes blockaded status when a planet/asteroid changes export target.
  (in case its still under siege it will regain status quickly)

### todo (ideas)
- rework pirates (smaller, interceptable, more hideouts, camping on lanes, occasional raid)
- change ore asteroids to use a mining bases like a resource (like `OreRate` resource)
    - with shards there would be one main roid per group where a mining base has to be built to start operations (maybe w/ fake ships).
    - like a resource, as soon as you connect it it's available, with a random yield ore/min on the receiving planet (or global)
    - maybe add upgrades (planet buildings or orbitals)
- change AI to care for all this (prob no pirates for them or fake ones)
- add inter-trade-station traffic as tech (for more income, maybe inter-empire as treaty, check treaty code functionality)
- change customs offices to be invul (or super-recharge) as long as there are supports around (so they can't be sniped)
- try to add new category (or whatever) to let player design it's civilian ships with hexes (miner/trader/hauler/etc), maybe spawn like supports
- add the ability to _just transport_ goods, with ships ofc. with storages, planets could be used as hubs to spread res where they're needed most.
- change planet requirements to not accept the same resource multiple times, or better only use up one worth of each res only. no more all-apples planets. make other soylents available (esp. the green one looks promising ;) )
