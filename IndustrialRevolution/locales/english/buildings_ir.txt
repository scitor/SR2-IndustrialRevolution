BLD_FTLBREEDER: FTL Breeder Reactor
BLD_FTLBREEDER_DESC: <<
	A high-power reactor used to efficiently extract large amounts of [img=ResourceIcon::3;20/] FTL energy from shards [img=ResourceIconsSmall::47;20/] while giving off radiation deadly to all organic life in the process.

	[bbloc=#GTT_ALIGNED_STAT:Cargo usage:60 FTL shards/min/]

BLD_CUSTOMS_OFFICE: Customs Office
BLD_CUSTOMS_OFFICE_DESC: <<
	Customs offices ease access to space by providing a trade connection to a platform in orbit around the planet.

	This is the command and coordination building required for the population on the planet. Once operational it will spawn the actual orbital itself.

	Increases trade ship spawn rate by [color=#00ff00]33%[/color][hr=#333/]
	[vspace=-16/](down from 3 to [b]every 2 minutes[/b])

	[i][color=#aaa]The amount of cargo generated by the resource will stay the same. There will be less cargo per run, resulting in smaller (faster) ships.[/color][/i]

	[i][color=#aaa]Customs offices participate in global trade, they are best used where valuable resources are being traded.[/color][/i]

ORB_FLING_CORE_DESC: <<|
	Allows use of fling-based FTL near the beacon.

	Ships within 125,00 distance units of a fling beacon can be FTLed to anywhere in the galaxy.

	[b]Fling Beacons cost [color=$FTL]250 FTL Energy[/color] [img=ResourceIcon::3;20/] to construct, and [color=$FTL]0.15 FTL/s[/color] in upkeep.[/b]

ORB_FTL_JAMMER_DESC: <<|
	An array of precise hyperfield excitors calibrated to specific frequencies
